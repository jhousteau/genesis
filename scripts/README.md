# Scripts Directory

Utility scripts for development and maintenance tasks.

## Organization

Scripts should be:
- Executable (`chmod +x`)
- Self-documenting with `--help`
- Generic (work for any project type)
- Follow naming: `action-target.sh`

## Examples
- `setup-dev.sh` - Development environment setup
- `clean-build.sh` - Clean build artifacts
- `check-health.sh` - Project health checks
