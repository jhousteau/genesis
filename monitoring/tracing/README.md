## Features

### Request Flow Tracing
- End-to-end request tracing across microservices
- Cross-service dependency mapping
- Request correlation and context propagation
- Async operation tracing
- Database query tracing
- External API call tracking

### Performance Analysis
- Latency breakdown by service and operation
- Bottleneck identification and root cause analysis
- Performance regression detection
- Capacity planning insights
- Critical path analysis
- Resource utilization correlation

### Error Propagation Tracking
- Error origin identification
- Error propagation paths
- Exception stack trace correlation
- Error rate analysis by service
- Error pattern detection
- Recovery time measurement

### Sampling Strategies
- Intelligent probabilistic sampling
- Error-biased sampling (always trace errors)
- Latency-based sampling (trace slow requests)
- Debug sampling for specific users/operations
- Custom business logic sampling
- Cost-optimized sampling rates
