## Template System

### Dashboard Generator

The automated dashboard generator (`templates/dashboard-generator.py`) creates tailored dashboards based on service metadata:

```bash
# Generate all dashboards for all services
cd templates/
python dashboard-generator.py --config services.yaml

# Generate specific dashboard type
python dashboard-generator.py --type infrastructure

# Generate for specific service only
python dashboard-generator.py --service my-service --type service_overview
```

#### Supported Dashboard Types
- **Service Overview**: Standard application monitoring (uptime, request rate, errors, latency)
- **Infrastructure**: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Business Metrics**: Custom KPIs and business logic
- **Security**: Authentication failures, security events, compliance
- **SLO Tracking**: Service level objective monitoring with error budgets
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource costs and optimization recommendations

#### Service Configuration

Configure services in `templates/services.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  - name: "user-service"
    type: "api"
    language: "python"
    framework: "fastapi"
    team: "platform"
    environment: "production"
    has_database: true
    has_cache: true
    has_queue: false
    custom_metrics:
      - "user_registrations_total"
    business_metrics:
      - "daily_active_users"
    slos:
      - name: "Availability"
        target: 99.9
        query: 'up{job="user-service"}'
```
