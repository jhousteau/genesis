## Features

### Structured JSON Logging
- Consistent JSON format across all applications
- Automatic metadata injection (service, version, environment)
- Request correlation IDs for tracing
- Contextual information preservation
- Performance metrics integration

### Centralized Collection
- Google Cloud Logging integration
- ELK Stack support (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Fluentd/Fluent Bit log forwarding
- Real-time log streaming
- Multi-environment log separation

### Log Correlation
- Request tracing across microservices
- User session correlation
- Error propagation tracking
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Cross-service dependency analysis

### Security Event Logging
- Authentication and authorization events
- Access pattern analysis
- Security incident detection
- Compliance audit trails
- PII detection and redaction

### Retention and Archival
- Environment-specific retention policies
- Cost-optimized storage tiers
- Automated archival to cold storage
- Compliance-driven retention rules
- GDPR-compliant data deletion

## Log Levels and Categories

### Standard Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARN**: Warning conditions that should be addressed
- **ERROR**: Error conditions that don't halt execution
- **FATAL**: Critical errors that cause application termination

### Log Categories
- **ACCESS**: HTTP requests and API access
- **AUTH**: Authentication and authorization
- **BUSINESS**: Business logic and transactions
- **PERFORMANCE**: Performance metrics and bottlenecks
- **SECURITY**: Security events and violations
- **AUDIT**: Compliance and audit events
