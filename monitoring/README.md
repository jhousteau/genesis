## Key Features

- **Zero-Configuration**: Automatic monitoring setup for new projects
- **Multi-Environment**: Dev, staging, and production monitoring
- **Intelligent Alerting**: SLO-based alerts with minimal false positives
- **Complete Coverage**: Application, infrastructure, security, and business metrics
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal performance impact on monitored systems
- **Cost Effective**: Efficient resource usage and storage policies

## Integration Points

This monitoring system integrates with:
- **Plumbing Libraries**: Automatic instrumentation included by default
- **Infrastructure Modules**: Monitoring resources provisioned automatically
- **Deployment System**: Deployment and rollback monitoring
- **Security System**: Security event monitoring and alerting
- **CLI**: Monitoring commands and health checks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enable monitoring for a project
bootstrap monitoring enable <project-name>

# View project health
bootstrap health <project-name>

# View logs
bootstrap logs <project-name>

# View metrics
bootstrap metrics <project-name>

# Manage alerts
bootstrap alerts <project-name>
```

## Components

### Metrics Collection (`metrics/`)
- Prometheus integration and configuration
- OpenTelemetry setup and instrumentation
- Custom metrics for application performance
- Infrastructure metrics collection
- Cost and resource utilization tracking
- SLA/SLO monitoring

### Logging Infrastructure (`logging/`)
- Google Cloud Logging integration
- Structured JSON logging formats
- Log correlation and tracing
- Retention and archival policies
- Security event logging
- Performance tracking

### Distributed Tracing (`tracing/`)
- OpenTelemetry tracing implementation
- Request flow visualization
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation tracking
- Cross-service dependency mapping

### Alert Management (`alerts/`)
- PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
- Slack notifications for team awareness
- Email alerting for non-critical events
- Alert fatigue prevention
- Escalation procedures

### Dashboard System (`dashboards/`)
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Google Cloud Console dashboards
- Application performance dashboards
- Infrastructure health dashboards
- Business metrics visualization

## Configuration

All monitoring components are configured through:
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Terraform variable overrides
- Project-specific customizations
- Team and organization policies

## Security

- All monitoring data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access controls based on IAM and RBAC
- Audit logging for all monitoring access
- PII detection and redaction
- Compliance with SOC2, HIPAA, and other standards

## Performance

- Minimal overhead (< 5% resource usage)
- Efficient sampling strategies
- Intelligent data aggregation
- Cost-optimized storage policies
- Performance impact monitoring
