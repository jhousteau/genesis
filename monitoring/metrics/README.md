## Supported Metrics

### Application Metrics
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Request rate (requests per second)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx responses)
- Throughput and capacity metrics
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Queue depth and processing times

### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU utilization and load
- Memory usage and available memory
- Disk I/O and storage usage
- Network traffic and connections
- Container resource consumption
- Kubernetes pod and node metrics

### Business Metrics
- User registrations and activations
- Feature usage and adoption
- Revenue and conversion metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- API usage by endpoint
- Geographic user distribution

### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation events
- Unusual access patterns
- Security scan results
- Compliance violations
- Vulnerability counts

### Cost Metrics
- Cloud resource costs by service
- Cost per request/transaction
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Budget variance tracking
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Reserved instance utilization

## Automatic Instrumentation

The system provides automatic instrumentation for:
- HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses
- Database queries (SQL, NoSQL)
- Cache operations (Redis, Memcached)
- Message queue operations
- External API calls
- Background job processing

## SLO/SLA Monitoring

Built-in support for:
- Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Error budget tracking
- Availability monitoring
- Performance threshold tracking
- Customer impact assessment

## Integration

Seamlessly integrates with:
- Google Cloud Monitoring
- Prometheus and Grafana
- Datadog (optional)
- New Relic (optional)
- Custom metrics endpoints
- Business intelligence tools
