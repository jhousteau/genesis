# Alert Management Framework

Comprehensive alerting system providing intelligent notifications, escalation procedures, and alert fatigue prevention across all platform services.

## Architecture

## Features

### Multi-Channel Alerting
- **PagerDuty**: Critical alerts requiring immediate response
- **Slack**: Team notifications and status updates
- **Email**: Non-critical alerts and summaries
- **Webhook**: Custom integrations and automation
- **SMS**: Emergency notifications for severe incidents

### Intelligent Alert Routing
- Severity-based routing to appropriate channels
- Team-based routing based on service ownership
- Time-based routing (business hours vs. after hours)
- Geographic routing for global teams
- Escalation chains with automatic promotion

### Alert Fatigue Prevention
- Alert correlation and deduplication
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Smart grouping of related alerts
- Automatic resolution of transient issues
- Alert suppression during maintenance

### SLO-Based Alerting
- Error budget burn rate alerts
- Availability threshold monitoring
- Latency percentile violations
- Throughput degradation detection
- Custom SLI/SLO monitoring

## Alert Categories

### Infrastructure Alerts
- **Critical**: Service down, database unavailable, storage full
- **Warning**: High CPU/memory usage, disk space low
- **Info**: Planned maintenance, deployment status

### Application Alerts
- **Critical**: Application crashes, authentication failures
- **Warning**: High error rates, slow response times
- **Info**: Feature flags, configuration changes

### Security Alerts
- **Critical**: Security breaches, unauthorized access
- **Warning**: Unusual access patterns, failed logins
- **Info**: Security scan results, compliance status

### Business Alerts
- **Critical**: Payment system down, data corruption
- **Warning**: Conversion rate drop, user engagement low
- **Info**: Daily/weekly reports, trend analysis
