# Worktree Documentation Instructions for AI Agents

## File Organization in This Worktree

### **ISOLATED FILES (Edit Freely)**
- `docs/` - This directory is ISOLATED to this worktree only
- `tests/` - Component-specific tests only (isolated)
- `scratch/` - Temporary files and experiments (isolated)

### **SHARED FILES (Minimal Set)**
- `Makefile` - Build, test, lint commands (shared across worktrees)
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies & config (shared across worktrees)
- `.envrc` - Environment setup (shared across worktrees)
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules (shared across worktrees)
- `README.md` - Main project overview (shared across worktrees)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main project AI instructions (shared across worktrees)

## Documentation Strategy

### **Document in docs/README.md**
1. **What changed** - List all files modified in this worktree
2. **Why** - Explain technical decisions and rationale
3. **Tests added** - Document any tests created in local tests/
4. **Follow-up** - What needs to happen next

### **True Isolation Benefits**
- Your docs/ is completely separate from other worktrees
- Your tests/ only contains tests for your component
- No merge conflicts with documentation or tests
- Changes to shared files propagate via Git operations

### **When You Need Global Resources**
If you need to reference global docs or scripts:
1. Document the need in your local docs/README.md
2. Describe what global changes might be needed
3. Work with local files first, promote to global later
