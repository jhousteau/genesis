# Release Notes

## Version 0.2.0 - Security & Isolation Update
*Released: August 21, 2025*

### 🎯 Overview

This release focuses on security enhancements and operational safety, introducing comprehensive git branch protection and GCloud environment isolation. These features prevent common but costly mistakes like accidental production deployments and cross-project contamination.

### 🌟 Major Features

#### Git Branch Protection System

We've implemented a robust branch protection system that prevents direct commits and pushes to main/master branches. This ensures all changes go through proper review processes via pull requests.

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental commits to production branches
- Enforces code review workflows
- Integrates with pre-commit framework for additional quality gates
- Provides clear error messages and guidance

**How It Works:**
The system uses two layers of protection:
1. Pre-commit hooks block commits at the local level
2. Pre-push hooks prevent pushes to remote protected branches

Emergency overrides are available but require explicit confirmation, maintaining a balance between safety and operational flexibility.

#### GCloud Environment Isolation

A sophisticated isolation system now ensures complete separation between development, staging, and production environments. Each environment uses its own isolated GCloud configuration directory, preventing the all-too-common mistake of running commands against the wrong project.

**Key Benefits:**
- Eliminates cross-project contamination
- Automatic environment detection and configuration
- Production safeguards with confirmation requirements
- Comprehensive audit logging of all operations

**Architecture:**
- Isolated configurations stored at `~/.gcloud/genesis-${ENVIRONMENT}`
- Automatic activation via direnv when entering the project
- Environment-specific PROJECT_IDs and settings
- Guard script validates all operations before execution

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Pre-commit Framework**: Integrated with multiple validators including:
  - Secret detection (gitleaks)
  - Terraform formatting and validation
  - Python code formatting (Black)
  - YAML/JSON validation
  - TODO/FIXME detection

- **Environment Configuration**: Centralized configuration system with:
  - `config/project.env` for project-wide settings
  - Environment-specific files in `config/environments/`
  - Utility functions for pattern expansion
  - Built-in validation

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides added:
  - Git Branch Protection Guide
  - GCP Environment Isolation Guide
  - Updated README with current project state

### 🚨 Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

### 📦 Installation & Upgrade

#### New Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhousteau/genesis.git
cd genesis
direnv allow
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
pre-commit install
```

#### Upgrading from 0.1.0
```bash
# Install direnv if not present
brew install direnv
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# In the project directory
direnv allow
pre-commit install
./scripts/bootstrap_gcloud.sh
```

## Version 0.1.0 - Foundation Release
*Released: August 20, 2025*

### 🎯 Overview

The initial foundation release of Genesis establishes the core infrastructure platform for Google Cloud Platform. This release provides a comprehensive, production-ready framework with intelligent automation, monitoring capabilities, and security best practices built-in from day one.

### 🌟 Major Features

#### Core Infrastructure Modules

We've created a complete set of Terraform modules covering all essential GCP services:

- **Bootstrap Module**: Automated project initialization and setup
- **Compute Module**: Support for GKE, Cloud Run, and Compute Engine
- **Networking Module**: VPC, subnets, and firewall configuration
- **Data Module**: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Firestore integration
- **Security Module**: IAM, Secret Manager, and security policies
- **Workload Identity**: Keyless CI/CD authentication

#### Intelligent Automation

The Genesis platform introduces three intelligent systems:

- **SOLVE**: Problem-solving orchestrator for complex deployments
- **Autofix**: Automated issue detection and resolution
- **Smart Commit**: Intelligent validation and quality gates

These systems work together to reduce manual intervention and improve deployment reliability.

#### Multi-Environment Support

Complete isolation and configuration for:
- Development
- Testing
- Staging
- Production

Each environment has its own:
- Terraform state management
- Network configuration
- Security policies
- Resource quotas
- Monitoring setup

### 🔧 Technical Foundation

- **Infrastructure as Code**: 100% Terraform-based
- **CI/CD Ready**: Templates for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
- **Monitoring Stack**: Integrated logging, metrics, and tracing
- **Security First**: Built-in scanning and compliance checks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and runbooks

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Initial setup
git clone https://github.com/jhousteau/genesis.git
cd genesis
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Configure environment
cp environments/dev.tfvars.example environments/dev.tfvars
# Edit tfvars with your settings

# Deploy
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

Genesis represents the culmination of best practices from multiple projects and the collective experience of cloud infrastructure management. We're excited to share this foundation with the community.

### 📊 Statistics
