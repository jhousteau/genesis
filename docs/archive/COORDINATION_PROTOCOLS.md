# Agent Coordination Protocols

## Executive Coordination Framework

### Daily Coordination Checklist (Project Manager)

#### Morning Standup (9 AM Pacific)
- [ ] Review overnight progress across all 5 work streams
- [ ] Identify any blockers or dependencies requiring resolution
- [ ] Coordinate handoffs between streams (especially TypeScript → MCP)
- [ ] Adjust timelines based on progress and risk assessment
- [ ] Update stakeholders on critical path status

#### Midday Check-in (1 PM Pacific)
- [ ] Validate quality gates and methodology adherence
- [ ] Review integration points and cross-stream coordination
- [ ] Address any escalated technical issues
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization and agent capacity

#### Evening Review (5 PM Pacific)
- [ ] Assess daily deliverables and milestone progress
- [ ] Plan tomorrow's priorities and agent assignments
- [ ] Update progress tracking and risk register
- [ ] Prepare stakeholder communications

### Work Stream Dependencies

#### Stream A → Stream C (TypeScript → MCP)
**Handoff Criteria**:
- [ ] `lib/javascript/@genesis/core/` modules functional
- [ ] TypeScript error handling and logging ready
- [ ] Genesis patterns documented for MCP integration
- [ ] Build pipeline validated for MCP server project

**Coordination Protocol**:
1. frontend-developer-agent commits TypeScript modules
2. integration-agent validates import compatibility
3. Joint testing of Genesis pattern integration
4. Handoff approval from both agents

#### Stream B1 → Stream B2 (VM → Container)
**Handoff Criteria**:
- [ ] VM provisioning templates validated
- [ ] Container runtime installation verified
- [ ] Monitoring integration functional
- [ ] Resource optimization parameters defined

**Coordination Protocol**:
1. platform-engineer-agent validates VM foundation
2. Container orchestration builds on VM templates
3. Integration testing of VM + Container workflows
4. Performance validation across both layers

#### Stream D Integration (Security → All)
**Integration Points**:
- TypeScript secrets library → MCP OAuth flows
- Container credential injection → VM security
- CLI secret management → All development workflows

**Coordination Protocol**:
1. security-agent delivers foundational libraries
2. Other agents integrate security patterns
3. End-to-end security validation testing
4. Compliance verification across all streams

- **Isolate**: Environment segregation validated
- **Encrypt**: OAuth storage secure, API key protection verified
- **Log**: Audit trails functional, compliance reporting ready
- **Defend**: Security monitoring active, incident procedures tested

#### Stream E (Quality): MENTOR Validation
- **Measure**: Quality metrics meet Genesis standards
- **Evaluate**: Code review standards enforced
- **Nurture**: Knowledge transfer completed
- **Transform**: Technical debt addressed
- **Optimize**: Performance benchmarks exceeded
- **Review**: Production readiness validated

### Risk Mitigation Protocols

#### Technical Risks
**TypeScript Integration Complexity**:
- Daily integration testing with existing Python components
- Escalation path to architect-agent for design decisions
- Fallback timeline with reduced scope if needed

**MCP Protocol Compliance**:
- Daily protocol validation against official specification
- Integration testing with real Claude Code instances
- Escalation to integration-agent methodology expertise

**VM Cost Overruns**:
- Daily cost monitoring and budget alerts
- Spot instance failover testing
- Escalation to platform-engineer-agent for optimization

#### Timeline Risks
**Cross-Stream Dependencies**:
- Daily dependency status check
- Alternative handoff scenarios prepared
- Critical path monitoring and adjustment

**Quality Gate Failures**:
- Immediate escalation to relevant methodology expert
- Quality remediation protocols
- Timeline adjustment procedures

#### Resource Risks
**Agent Capacity Constraints**:
- Work rebalancing across streams
- Priority adjustment protocols
- Additional resource allocation procedures

### Communication Framework

#### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- **Technical Issues**: Direct GitHub issue comments with @mentions
- **Handoff Coordination**: Shared documentation with validation checklists
- **Integration Testing**: Joint test execution and result validation
- **Quality Reviews**: Cross-agent methodology validation

#### Agent-to-Project Manager Communication
- **Daily Status**: Progress updates via GitHub issue comments
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediate notification with proposed solutions
- **Quality Gate Status**: Methodology validation results
- **Timeline Updates**: Revised estimates with risk assessment

#### Project Manager-to-Stakeholders Communication
- **Daily Dashboard**: Progress metrics and quality gate status
- **Weekly Summary**: Executive overview with risk assessment
- **Milestone Reports**: Detailed deliverable validation
- **Migration Readiness**: Go/no-go decision criteria and validation

### Success Validation Framework

#### Technical Readiness Validation
```bash
# Claude-talk deployment test
g mcp deploy claude-talk --env staging
curl -X POST http://claude-talk/health

# Agent-cage container test
g container deploy agent-cage --vm-managed
docker ps | grep agent-cage

# OAuth integration test
g secrets validate oauth-flow claude-talk
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- TypeScript module import time < 100ms
- VM provisioning time < 5 minutes
- Container startup time < 30 seconds
- MCP protocol response time < 200ms
- Secret retrieval time < 50ms

#### Quality Standards
