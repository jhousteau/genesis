# GCP Bootstrap Deployer - Architecture

## Overview

The GCP Bootstrap Deployer implements a modular, scalable architecture for provisioning and managing Google Cloud Platform infrastructure using Terraform. The architecture follows cloud-native principles with a focus on security, automation, and multi-environment support.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- All infrastructure defined in Terraform
- Version controlled configurations
- Reproducible deployments
- Drift detection and remediation

### 2. GitOps Workflow
- Git as single source of truth
- Pull request-based changes
- Automated validation and testing
- Continuous deployment pipelines

### 3. Zero Trust Security
- Workload Identity Federation for authentication
- No long-lived credentials
- Least privilege access model
- Defense in depth approach

### 4. Multi-Environment Strategy
- Isolated environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Progressive deployment model
- Rollback capabilities

## System Components

### Core Infrastructure Layer

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "GCP Organization"
        subgraph "Bootstrap Project"
            TB[Terraform Backend]
            WIF[Workload Identity]
            SA[Service Accounts]
        end
        
        subgraph "Environment Projects"
            DEV[Dev Environment]
            STG[Staging Environment]
            PRD[Production Environment]
        end
    end
    
    subgraph "CI/CD"
        GH[GitHub Actions]
        GL[GitLab CI]
    end
    
    subgraph "Developer"
        TF[Terraform CLI]
        GC[gcloud CLI]
    end
    
    GH --> WIF
    GL --> WIF
    TF --> TB
    GC --> SA
    WIF --> DEV
    WIF --> STG
    WIF --> PRD
```

### Terraform State Management

The architecture uses a centralized state management approach:

1. **Remote Backend**: GCS bucket for state storage
2. **State Locking**: Prevents concurrent modifications
3. **Versioning**: Historical state preservation
4. **Encryption**: At-rest encryption for security
5. **Workspaces**: Environment isolation

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "terraform-state-${project_id}"
    prefix = "bootstrap"
  }
}
```

### Authentication Architecture

#### Workload Identity Federation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CI as CI/CD Platform
    participant WIF as Workload Identity Pool
    participant SA as Service Account
    participant GCP as GCP Resources
    
    CI->>CI: Generate OIDC Token
    CI->>WIF: Present OIDC Token
    WIF->>WIF: Validate Token
    WIF->>SA: Generate Access Token
    SA->>CI: Return GCP Access Token
    CI->>GCP: Access Resources
    GCP->>GCP: Validate Permissions
    GCP->>CI: Return Response
```

Benefits:
- No service account keys to manage
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour default)
- Attribute-based access control
- Auditable access patterns

### Network Architecture

#### VPC Design

```yaml
Network Topology:
  - Hub-Spoke Model
  - Regional VPCs per environment
  - Subnet per availability zone
  - Private Google Access enabled
  - Cloud NAT for egress
```

#### Network Segmentation

| Environment | CIDR Block | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Development | 10.0.0.0/16 | Dev workloads |
| Staging | 10.1.0.0/16 | Pre-prod testing |
| Production | 10.2.0.0/16 | Production services |
| Management | 10.255.0.0/16 | Shared services |

   - VPC Service Controls

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest (Cloud KMS)
   - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Secret Manager for credentials
   - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

4. **Monitoring & Compliance**
   - Cloud Security Command Center

   - Access Transparency logs
   - Compliance validation

### CI/CD Architecture

```yaml
Workflow Stages:
  1. Code Checkout
  2. Security Scanning
     - Secret detection
     - SAST analysis
     - Dependency scanning
  3. Terraform Validation
     - Format check
     - Syntax validation
     - Policy compliance
  4. Plan Generation
     - Cost estimation
     - Change preview
     - Risk assessment
  5. Manual Approval (prod)
  6. Apply Changes
  7. Post-deployment Tests
  8. Notification
```

#### GitLab CI Pipeline

Similar structure with GitLab-specific features:
- Dynamic environments
- Review apps
- Merge request integration
- Container scanning

### Deployment Patterns

#### Blue-Green Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    LB[Load Balancer]
    BLUE[Blue Environment<br/>Current Version]
    GREEN[Green Environment<br/>New Version]
    
    LB -->|100% traffic| BLUE
    LB -.->|0% traffic| GREEN
    
    style BLUE fill:#4285F4
    style GREEN fill:#34A853
```

#### Canary Deployment

Progressive rollout strategy:
1. Deploy to canary (5% traffic)
2. Monitor metrics and errors
3. Gradually increase traffic
4. Full rollout or rollback

### Disaster Recovery

#### Backup Strategy

- **State Files**: Versioned in GCS with 90-day retention
- **Configuration**: Git repository with tagged releases
- **Data**: Automated snapshots and exports
- **Secrets**: Secret Manager with versioning

#### Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | RTO | RPO | Recovery Method |
|----------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| State corruption | 15 min | 0 | Restore from GCS version |
| Environment failure | 30 min | 1 hour | Redeploy from Git |
| Regional outage | 2 hours | 4 hours | Failover to DR region |
| Complete loss | 4 hours | 24 hours | Full restore from backups |
