# Genesis Governance

Comprehensive governance, compliance, and policy framework for Genesis Universal Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

The governance system provides enterprise-grade compliance, security, and policy management:

- **Policy as Code** - Automated policy enforcement
- **Compliance Frameworks** - SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS
- **Security Scanning** - Comprehensive security validation
- **Cost Control** - Budget enforcement and optimization
- **Audit Framework** - Complete audit trail and reporting

## Key Features

### Policy as Code
Automated policy enforcement using:
- **Terraform Sentinel** - Infrastructure policy validation
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** - Kubernetes and application policies
- **Cloud Security Command Center** - GCP security policies
- **Custom Policy Engines** - Genesis-specific policy enforcement

### Compliance Frameworks

#### SOC2 Type 2
- Security controls and monitoring
- Availability and performance tracking
- Processing integrity validation
- Confidentiality and privacy protection

#### ISO 27001
- Information security management system
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Security control implementation
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

#### GDPR
- Data protection and privacy controls
- Consent management and tracking
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Breach detection and reporting

#### HIPAA (Healthcare)
- Protected health information controls
- Access controls and audit logging
- Encryption and transmission security
- Business associate agreements

#### PCI-DSS (Payment Cards)
- Cardholder data protection
- Network security controls
- Vulnerability management
- Access control and monitoring

### Security Scanning
Comprehensive security validation:
- **Static Analysis** - Code security scanning with bandit, semgrep
- **Container Scanning** - Image vulnerability assessment
- **Infrastructure Scanning** - Terraform security validation
- **Dependency Scanning** - Third-party package vulnerability assessment
- **Secrets Detection** - Prevent hardcoded secrets and keys

### Cost Control
Enterprise cost management:
- **Budget Enforcement** - Automatic budget alerts and controls
- **Resource Quotas** - Prevent resource over-provisioning
- **Cost Optimization** - AI-driven optimization recommendations
- **Spend Analytics** - Detailed cost analysis and reporting

## Usage

### Policy Enforcement
```bash
# Validate infrastructure against policies
terraform plan | opa eval -d governance/policies/gcp/ -

# Run security scanning
./governance/security-scanning/comprehensive-security-scanning.yaml

# Generate compliance report
python governance/reporting/compliance-dashboard-automation.yaml
```

### Compliance Validation
```bash
# SOC2 compliance check
./governance/compliance/soc2/validate.sh

# GDPR privacy assessment
./governance/compliance/gdpr/privacy-assessment.sh

# ISO27001 security controls audit
./governance/compliance/iso27001/security-audit.sh
```

### Cost Control
```bash
# Set budget alerts
gcloud billing budgets create --billing-account=$BILLING_ACCOUNT \
  --display-name="Genesis Development" \
  --budget-amount=1000

# Optimize costs
./governance/cost-control/optimization/cost-optimizer.sh

# Generate cost report
./governance/cost-control/reporting/cost-analysis.sh
```

## Integration

### CI/CD Integration
Governance checks are integrated into all CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/governance.yml
- name: Policy Validation
  run: |
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    opa eval -d governance/policies/ --input tfplan

- name: Security Scanning
  run: |
    bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code clair-scanner

- name: Compliance Check
  run: |
    ./governance/compliance/validate-all.sh
```

### Monitoring Integration
Governance metrics and alerts:
- **Policy Violations** - Real-time policy violation alerts
- **Compliance Drift** - Continuous compliance monitoring
- **Security Events** - Security incident detection and response
- **Cost Anomalies** - Unusual spend pattern detection

### Audit Integration
Complete audit trail:
- **Change Tracking** - All infrastructure and code changes
- **Access Logging** - User access and permissions
- **Activity Monitoring** - System and user activity
- **Evidence Collection** - Automated evidence for compliance audits

```

## Reporting

### Compliance Reports
- **SOC2 Readiness** - Control implementation status
- **GDPR Compliance** - Data protection assessment
- **Security Posture** - Security control effectiveness
- **Cost Efficiency** - Cost optimization opportunities

### Audit Reports

- **Access Report** - User access patterns and permissions
- **Incident Report** - Security incidents and response
- **Compliance Evidence** - Evidence for compliance audits

## Development

### Adding New Policies
1. Define policy requirements in YAML
2. Implement policy validation logic
3. Add to CI/CD pipeline validation
4. Update monitoring and alerting
5. Document policy requirements

### Custom Compliance Framework
1. Define compliance requirements
2. Map to existing controls or create new ones
3. Implement validation and monitoring
4. Create reporting templates
5. Update documentation
