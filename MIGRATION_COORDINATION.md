- Unified secrets access (Python + TypeScript)
- OAuth and API key management
- Configuration hierarchy and validation
- Security policies and compliance
- CLI secret management commands

**Timeline**: Week 1-2
**Dependencies**: Integrates with TypeScript support
**Handoff**: Enables secure credential flows

### Stream E: Quality Validation
**Agent**: tech-lead-agent
**Methodology**: MENTOR (Measure, Evaluate, Nurture, Transform, Optimize, Review)
**Issues**: #2 (Core Infrastructure), #3 (SOLVE Integration)
**Deliverables**:
- Foundation issue validation and closure
- Code quality assessment and standards
- Production readiness checklist
- Integration testing coordination
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

**Timeline**: Week 2-3
**Dependencies**: Foundation work completion
**Handoff**: Production deployment readiness

## Coordination Protocols

### Daily Standup (Project Manager)
- Progress assessment across all streams
- Blocker identification and resolution
- Dependency coordination and timeline adjustments
- Quality gate validation

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Foundation work (TypeScript, VM, Secrets)
- **Week 2**: Integration work (MCP, Containers, Quality)
- **Week 3**: Migration execution and validation

### Quality Gates
- Each agent must meet methodology standards
- Cross-stream integration testing required
- Security validation for all credential flows
- Performance benchmarks for all components

## Success Metrics

### Technical Readiness
- [ ] claude-talk MCP server deployable on Genesis
- [ ] agent-cage containers manageable with VM lifecycle
- [ ] OAuth flows secure and compliant
- [ ] All smart-commit quality gates functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Migration Readiness
- [ ] Zero critical path blockers remaining
- [ ] Production deployment scripts validated
- [ ] Documentation complete for both projects
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

### Business Impact
- [ ] Development velocity increased
- [ ] Infrastructure costs optimized
- [ ] Security posture improved
- [ ] Compliance requirements met
- [ ] Team productivity enhanced

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **TypeScript integration complexity**: Mitigated by frontend-developer-agent expertise
- **MCP protocol compliance**: Mitigated by integration-agent systematic approach
- **VM cost optimization**: Mitigated by platform-engineer-agent PIPES methodology

### Timeline Risks
- **Cross-stream dependencies**: Mitigated by daily coordination and flexible handoffs
- **Quality gate failures**: Mitigated by tech-lead-agent continuous validation
- **Integration issues**: Mitigated by weekly integration checkpoints

### Resource Risks
- **Agent capacity constraints**: Mitigated by parallel execution and workload balancing
- **Knowledge transfer gaps**: Mitigated by documentation requirements and reviews
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Mitigated by quality gates and methodology adherence

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Daily**: Progress dashboard updates
- **Weekly**: Executive summary to stakeholders
- **Milestone**: Detailed progress and quality reports
- **Completion**: Migration success validation and retrospective

### Agent Coordination
- **Real-time**: Shared progress tracking
- **Daily**: Cross-agent dependency check-ins
- **Weekly**: Integration and quality validation
- **Completion**: Knowledge transfer and documentation handoff

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Agents**: Begin parallel execution across all work streams
2. **Establish Monitoring**: Set up progress tracking and quality dashboards
3. **Coordinate Dependencies**: Monitor handoffs and integration points
4. **Validate Quality**: Ensure methodology adherence and standards compliance
5. **Execute Migration**: Coordinate final migration when all streams complete
