## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Isolation for GCP

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project"
export ENVIRONMENT="dev"  # or staging, prod
export REGION="us-central1"

# Bootstrap isolation
./isolation/gcp/scripts/bootstrap_gcloud.sh

# Enable direnv (if using)
direnv allow

# Validate setup
./isolation/validation/isolation_validator.sh validate
```
