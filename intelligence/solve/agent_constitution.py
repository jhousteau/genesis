Agent Constitution Templates for SOLVE

This module provides constitution templates and principles for different types
of agents within the SOLVE system. Each agent type has specific constitutional
guidance tailored to their role and responsibilities.

Based on the unified agentic architecture from:
- docs/best-practices/11-unified-agentic-architecture.md
- docs/guides/AGENT_SAFETY_PRINCIPLES.md
