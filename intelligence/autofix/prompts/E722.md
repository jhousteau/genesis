# E722: Bare Except Statement

## Error Description
Do not use bare `except:` - it catches all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt.

## Fix Instructions
Replace `except:` with `except Exception:`

## Critical Rules
1. ONLY change the except line itself
2. Preserve the EXACT indentation (count the spaces/tabs)
3. Do NOT modify any other lines
4. Do NOT add comments or explanations
5. The line number must remain the same

## Examples

### Input
```python
883:                 except:
```

### Output
```
883:                 except Exception:
```

### Input with different indentation
```python
42:     except:
```

### Output
```
42:     except Exception:
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Changing indentation
- ❌ Adding type annotations
- ❌ Modifying nearby lines
- ❌ Adding comments like "# Fixed E722"
- ❌ Changing the line number format

## Output Format
Only output the fixed line in this exact format:
```
<line_number>: <fixed_line_with_original_indentation>
```

CRITICAL: You MUST include all the original indentation (spaces/tabs) before the code!
